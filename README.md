## Goal: ##
- Is there a method to roll the dice to get a higher number on average?

### My Testing: ###
Yes it seems, but probably will be called cheating already.

Average is 3.5 for the standard cases.

Spinning on a corner could lead to a range of 2.00 to 5.00 depending on the corner.
The best corner is [4,5,6]
